<title>PH demo tutorial | This paragraph here was added locally via ubuntu/atom after the webpage was put up online and I could access it at ancu6230.github.io/PHdemo. I had problems making the first commit in it’s entirety- _site got left behind for some reason. Here I’m seeing if it’s all happy now. Going to run: bundle exec jekyll serve here and then see if I can commit the changes. Making another change after published to see what happens!!!!! This description was written in atom. While inside the project directory I used atom . to open the _config.yml. Hopefully carriage returns don’t break anything. This description should appear in your document head meta (for Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.</title>
