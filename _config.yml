# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This description was written in atom. While inside the project directory I
  used atom . to open the _config.yml. Hopefully carriage returns don't break
  anything. This description should appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "/PHdemo" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog PH: use the website folder name
url: "http://ancu6230.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site PH: used the localhost for testing
twitter_username: tweettweet
github_username:  ancu6239
